<h2>Motivation</h2>
Experiment with pnpm which is uses linking strategy to reduces disk space usage and speeds up the installation process

<h2>Setup</h2>
install once pnpm globally (must ??)


<h2>Usage</h2>
invoke one

```
pnpm i
```

remove node_modules

```
pnpm i
```

The second time will be x10 time faster because the files all ready are on the local .pnpm store
